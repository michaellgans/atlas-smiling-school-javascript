# Atlas Smiling School

## Introduction

This is the last project in a series of Web Development projects called Smile School!  First, we were taught the basics of HTML and CSS, building a static version of this site from scratch based on a design created on Figma.  We then rebuilt the site again using Bootstrap to learn how to incorperate their style sheets and edit their components.  Finally, we have added JavaScript and JQuery to this project to dynamically generate the content that was previously hard coded.  We also upgraded the carousels from Bootstrap Carousels to Slick Carousels to give the user a smoother transition from card to card.
